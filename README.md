# odin-recipes

The first project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) aimed to consolidate basic HTML knowledge. It's a basic site with few pages that contain food recipes.

It requires knowledge of HTML tags such as headers, paragraphs, and lists. Boilerplate code is also a necessity to solidify it in memory before using autocompletion functions in modern text editors.

Equally important will be working with git system. Use it basic functionality to save and keep track of any changes during code writing. Especially it commit system.
